Hypothesis Two : Pandemic
=========================

Hypothesis Two addresses time; considering the pandemic occurred in **2020 and 2021**. 

**Have the crimes reported during and after the pandemic really changed a lot in Los Angeles?**

Categorizing
------------

For the task of categorizing crimes, the categorization provided by the website was used [file: UCR-COMPSTAT062618.pdf]. 
However, among the most frequently reported crimes, some of them were not listed there, which necessitated the manual 
classification of a few.

Thus, the most relevant ones were divided into 11 groups. The remaining ones, due to their lack of similarity 
and in order to avoid data loss, were placed in the 12th group 'Others'.
That is, we have: 

- **Assaults, Burglary, Car Theft, Disappearance, Homicides, Others, Personal Theft, Possession of Weapons or Drugs, Property Theft, Rape, Robbery, Traffic Incidents**

Furthermore, 2024 had to be viewed differently. Since data was available until part of September, there was a process 
of projecting cases for 2024, using the average of the cases. Therefore, if *80 cases* occurred, it will be shown as *120 
cases*, for example.

Of course, this is not the best method due to the likely increase in the crime rate during the end-of-year period. 
However, for a more superficial analysis, this factor will be suppressed.

By year
~~~~~~~

Initially, the analysis is conducted for each year to understand how the distribution of crimes is.

In Los Angeles, certain types of crimes stand out, such as *Car Theft*, *Assaults*, and *Property Theft*. However, 
over the 5 years, nothing seems to deviate from the trend; every year follows a nearly identical pattern. Because 
of this, a more detailed analysis was necessary.

- It is observed that even using the projection for 2024, there are significantly fewer cases in most categories.

Therefore, we can see some patterns:

1. **Relatively fewer cases during the pandemic:**

  - **Assaults, Burglary, Disappearance, Others, Personal Theft, Property Theft**

2. **Relatively more cases during the pandemic:**

  - **Possession of Weapons or Drugs** 

3. **It increased in 2021 and 2022, but returned to a decline:**

  - **Homicides, Traffic Incidents**

4. **There were practically no changes:**

  - **Car Theft, Rape, Robbery**

Conclusion
----------

In this way, we observe that of the 3 most common crimes, 2 of them (*Assaults* and *Personal Theft*) were more 
significant after 2021. while *Car Theft* changed very little.

**Suspicion about Car Theft:** Since it occurs quite frequently, it is a sort of 'theft culture,' so the 
pandemic wouldn't have much effect.

**Suspicion about Assaults e Personal Theft**: Since they are crimes more focused on individuals, isolation 
(even if partial) may have resulted in fewer occurrences. For example, *Disappearance*' saw a significant decrease in 2021.


Thus, it is evident that the pandemic influenced most types of crimes (especially those that require more contact).

However, we see, for example, cases of *Possession of Weapons or Drugs*, which experienced a noticeable decline post-pandemic.
This is not necessarily connected to the dynamics that the pandemic brought; it could have been influenced by external activities,
such as increased severity in searches and seizures, among other possible influences.

Therefore, **numerically**, it did change with the pandemic, but can we say it was **due to** the pandemic? *One cannot definitively
assert this!* However, it is certain that what the world experienced during the pandemic caused changes, just like the crimes.
